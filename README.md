## Dev notes

### Nodes.js version
We pick up node.js version 12 as default in all node.js related projects. 
Based on [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/), currently version 12 is recommended for most users. 
Based on [node.js release page](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), the odd number release has only 6 months support cycle, so we don't set it as default.
If you plan to try the different node.js version in sample projects, you can
 - modify `.nvmrc` file, so command `nvm install` and `nvm use` will pick up the node.js version you set.
 - modify `package.json` file, especially "engineStrict" and "engines.node" fields. It affects the version check when running `npm install`
